# SOFTWARE
There are two ways the hard way or the easier way.
# Hard way - In this Build you can build your own custom ROMS or games. NOT for beginner.
1.) First Download the Official Retropie Image https://retropie.org.uk/download/
2.) Flash the Downloaded Retropie Image to the SD Card using the SD card reader. 
3.) After flashing insert the SD Card to the raspberry pi then connect the raspberry pi to the LCD (After booting you notice there are no games)
4.) Games for retropie need Three things, ROMS, Emulator and Bios. https://retropie.org.uk/docs/
To Download and to set it up all correctly is hard for beginner cause you need the right setup  for emulator and bios to work it perfectly and its really time consumming. 
Wanna take the challenge and download Roms on your own? here are some sites that i think are safe .
-Gamulator
-GaROMs
-Retrosic
